## Understanding GDPR: What you need to know



The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a set of regulations that governs how companies collect and use personal data from individuals in the European Union. The regulation was implemented on May 25, 2018, and applies to any company that collects or processes personal data from EU citizens, regardless of where the company is located.

### Key Provisions of GDPR

- **Consent:** Companies must obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting or processing their personal data. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.
- **Right to Access:** Individuals have the right to access their personal data that is being collected or processed by a company. They can request a copy of their data, as well as information on how it is being used.
- **Right to Be Forgotten:** Individuals have the right to request that their personal data be deleted if it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.
- **Data Portability:** Individuals have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit that data to another controller.

### Compliance with GDPR

In order to comply with GDPR, companies must implement a number of measures, including:

- Appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO)
- Conducting a data protection impact assessment (DPIA)
- Implementing data protection policies and procedures
- Providing data protection training to employees
- Ensuring data security and privacy by design

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

The penalties for non-compliance with GDPR can be severe. Companies can be fined up to â‚¬20 million or 4% of their global annual revenue, whichever is higher. In addition to financial penalties, companies can also face reputational damage and loss of customer trust.

## Conclusion

GDPR is a complex regulation, but it is essential for companies that collect or process personal data from EU citizens to understand and comply with its provisions. By doing so, companies can protect their customers' privacy and avoid costly penalties for non-compliance.
